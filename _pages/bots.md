I have a few projects atm in the bot realm.  I'm currently working on more <a href="https://errbot.io">Errbot</a> Plugins.  The first one I wrote is to assist people with <a href="https://mycroft.ai">Mycroft AI</a> related questions and eventually interact with a Mycroft instance.  You can currently play with it live via https://chat.mycroft.ai on the mattermost server and there is a bot-testing channel for testing it.

You can find more information on the current project <a href="https://github.com/btotharye/err-mycroft">Here</a> on github and please contribute if interested.  Also working on a more official Mycroft Version located at https://github.com/MycroftAI/chatter codenamed Chatter atm.

I currently have it connected to Slack, Mattermost, and Telegram.  You can see some screenshot examples below:
