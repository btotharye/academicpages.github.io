I have a few projects atm in the bot realm.  I'm currently working on more <a href="https://errbot.io">Errbot</a> Plugins.  The first one I wrote is to assist people with <a href="https://mycroft.ai">Mycroft AI</a> related questions and eventually interact with a Mycroft instance.

You can find more information on the current project <a href="https://github.com/btotharye/err-mycroft">Here</a> on github and please contribute if interested.

I currently have it connected to Slack, Mattermost, and Telegram.  You can see some screenshot examples below:
